Here's the explanation of the Schrödinger Equation in Markdown format:

# The Schrödinger Equation: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction
The Schrödinger Equation, developed by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1925, is a fundamental cornerstone of quantum mechanics. It describes the quantum state evolution of physical systems over time.

## Main Forms of the Equation

### 1. Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
```math
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```
Expanded form:
```math
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = [-ℏ²/2m ∇² + V(r,t)]ψ
```

### 2. Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
```math
Ĥψ = Eψ
```
Expanded form:
```math
[-ℏ²/2m ∇² + V(r)]ψ = Eψ
```

## Key Components and Symbols
- **ψ (psi)**: Wave function
- **ℏ (h-bar)**: Reduced Planck's constant
- **i**: Imaginary unit
- **Ĥ**: Hamiltonian operator
- **V**: Potential energy
- **m**: Particle mass
- **∇²**: Laplacian operator
- **E**: System energy
